# JDR_Portfolio

A portfolio of deployed web applications for potential employers to review.

This site will be a WIP for some time. Ver 1.0 should be, as an initial launch, a functional site, if rather lacking in content. As my skills progress and I complete more deployed web applications, the portfolio will be updated and refined. As with any active web developer, the portfolio will never be finished, per se, merely expanded upon. The goal is to tastefully and functionally present a brief bio, a sample of extant works, and contact information.
